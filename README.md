midje99
======

This is a port of [etorreborres](https://github.com/etorreborre) eminent [s99](https://github.com/etorreborre/s99) made with
[clojure](http://clojure.org/) and [midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje)

Each Specification is divided into:

* the description of the problem to solve (see ListsSpec for an example)
* the methods to implement (see ListsSolutions for an example)

Use [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) to build:

    >lein clean
    >lein deps

To run the tests continuously:

    >lein midje --lazytest
  

Have fun!
